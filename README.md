# Vokabellernen

## Hello ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my first project using QT and C++.

### What is the aim of this project :question:
First of all, a bit of history about my learning of English.

I use an EXCEL sheet to write English words alongside their French translations. After printing and cutting them out, I fold and store them in a bag. This allows me to randomly draw a paper and practice guessing the corresponding word in either language. This method has proven to be a successful and engaging way for me to memorize vocabulary.

Therefore, my goal was to develop an application on my computer to learn German words.

My application is integrated with a database, and it encompasses various functionalities. The first page enables me to add new words to the database, while the second page permits me to randomly draw a word and select whether I wish to guess its French/English or German translation. Moreover, the third page facilitates the practice of identifying the appropriate article (das, der, or die) of a given noun, and the fourth page involves guessing the plural form of a noun.

### But Agathe, this type of application already exists, so why do you want to rebuild another one?

Yes, I know. But I discovered the field of software and especially user interface creation in my current company. I really like it!!! Mixing the "artistic" field with programming is very satisfying for me. So I decided to create my own software and to learn a new language: C++.

### Here are the different features of my software : 

This is the menu page.

This is the last button on the menu page. It allows to see the list of guessed words.
The last 3 images work together. The "Ok" button saves a text file of the guessed words. Each line is added below the others and each word in each line separated by a ";".
